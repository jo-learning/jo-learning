            <h1>Introduction to AI</h1>
            <h2>What is AI</h2>
            <p>According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy, AI is “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”. <br> 
            Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Applications of AI</h2>
            <p>AI has been dominant in various fields such as:</p>
            <h4>• Gaming</h4>
            <p>AI plays crucial role in strategic games such as chess, poker, tic-tac-toe, etc., where machine can think of large number of possible positions based on heuristic knowledge. </p>
            <h4>• Natural Language Processing</h4>
            <p>It is possible to interact with the computer that understands natural language spoken by humans.</p>
            <h4>• Expert Systems</h4>
            <p>There are some applications which integrate machine, software,and special information to impart reasoning and advising. They provide explanation and advice to the users. </p>
            <h4>• Vision Systems</h4>
            <p>These systems understand, interpret, and comprehend visual input on the computer. For example, </p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">1. A spying airplane takes photographs which are used to figure out spatial information or map of the areas.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">2. Doctors use clinical expert system to diagnose the patient.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">3. Police use computer software that can recognize the face of criminal with the stored portrait made by forensic artist.</p>
            <h4>• Speech Recognition</h4>
            <p>Some intelligent systems are capable of hearing and comprehending the language in terms of sentences and their meanings while a human talks to it. It can handle different accents, slang words, noise in the background, change in human’s noise due to cold, etc. </p>
            <h4>• Handwriting Recognition</h4>
            <p>The handwriting recognition software reads the text written on paper by a pen or on screen by a stylus. It can recognize the shapes of the letters and convert it into editable text.</p>
            <h4>• Intelligent Robots</h4>
            <p>Robots are able to perform the tasks given by a human. They have sensors to detect physical data from the real world such a slight, heat, temperature, movement, sound, bump, and pressure. They have efficient processors, multiple sensors and huge memory, to exhibit intelligence. In addition, they are capable of learning from their mistakes and they can adapt to the new environment.</p>
