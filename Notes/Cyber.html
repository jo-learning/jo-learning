            <h1>Introduction to Cyber Fundamental</h1>
            <h2>What is Cyber</h2>
            <p>Cyber came from cybernetics :  In the late 1940s, cybernetics arose as the study of control systems and communications between people and machines <br> 
            Cyber as a word is: 
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">* Not portmanteau</p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">* But Compound word</p>
            <br>
            <h2>We use Cyber with other words, for example:</h2>

            <h4>CyberSpace</h4>
            <p>Cyberspace refers to the virtual computer world, and more specifically, an electronic medium that is used to facilitate online communication. Cyberspace typically involves a large computer network made up of many worldwide computer subnetworks that employ TCP/IP protocol to aid in communication and data exchange activities. <br>
            Cyberspace allows users to share information, interact, swap ideas, play games, engage in discussions or social forums, conduct business and create intuitive media, among many other activities.
            </p>
            <h4>Characterstics of cyberspace?</h4>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">* Cyberspace's core feature is an interactive and virtual environment for a broad range of participants.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">* Identity and flexibility: the lack of physical interaction face to face causes an impact on how people present their identification. Well, you have the opportunity to express only some parts of your identity or maybe stay anonymous, you can even have an imaginary or false identity.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">* In cyberspace, we all have the same communication opportunity. Some call this Net Democracy.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">* It transcends spatial boundaries: Geographic distances do not limit who can communicate with whom. You can communicate with anyone who is in another country.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">* Extended and condensed time: there may be communication with anyone via the internet, and several people sitting on the computer.</p>
            <p>The cyberspace results in cybercommunity who play the role in it:</p>
            <div style="display:flex;"><h4>Cybercommunity > </h4><p style="margin-left:10px;padding-top: 25px;">Community who perform their daily activities in the cyber space.</p></div>
            <p>As a result of the cyberspace characterstics:</p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">* Cybercrime, Cyberattack, Cyber Terrorism, Cyberbullying</p>

            




            <h4>Cybercrime / Crminals in use the feature of cyberspace</h4>
            <p>cybercrime, also called computer crime, the use of a computeras an instrument to further illegal ends, such as</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:50px;">* committing fraud,</p>

            <p>Cybercrime, especially through the Internet, has grown in importance as the computer has become central to commerce, entertainment, and government.</p>
            <p>What distinguishes cybercrime from traditional criminal activity? Obviously, one difference is the use of the digital computer.</p>
            <p>Although the attacks do not take place on a physical body, they do take place on the personal or corporate virtual body, which is the set of informational attributes that define people and institutions on the Internet.</p>

            <h4>Cyber Terrorism / Terrorists use the feature of cyberspace</h4>
            <p>Cyberterrorism is defined as a premeditated attack against a computer system, computer data,programs and other information with the sole aim of violence against clandestine agents andsubnational groups. The main aim behind cyberterrorism is to cause harm and destruction. <br>
            Cyberterrorism can be explained also as internet terrorism. With the advent of the internet,individuals and groups are misusing the anonymity to threaten individuals, certain groups,religions, ethnicities or beliefs.
            </p>


            <h4>Cyberattack</h4>

            <h4>Cybersovernighty</h4>
            <p>This is a phrase commonly used in the field of internet governance to define the will of states to exercise and sustain control over the Internet domain within their own borders, including political, economic, cultural and technological activities. However, it is not clear how to apply this sovereigntyconcept to current international relations and international laws. <br>
            Ex: Chinas Great Firewall.

            <div style="display:flex;"><h4>Cyber forensics / Computer Forensics > </h4><p style="margin-left:10px;padding-top: 25px;">Investigation of cyber crime. Crimes conducted using deigitl devices.</p></div>
            <h4>Cyber warfare</h4>
            <p>The generally accepted definition of cyberwarfare is the use of cyber attacksagainst a nation-state, causing it significant harm, up to and including physical warfare, disruption of vital computer systems and loss of life.</p>
            <p>However, there has been some debate among experts regarding what acts specifically qualify as cyberwarfare. While the United States Department of Defense (DOD) states that the use of computers and the internet to conduct warfare in cyberspace is a threat to national security, whycertain activities qualify as warfare, while others are simply cybercrime, is unclear.</p>
            <h5>What kinds of cyber weapons are used in warfare?</h5>
            <p>Examples of acts that might qualify as cyberwarfare include the following:</p>
                <p style="margin-left:50px;">* viruses, phishing, computer worms and malwarethat can take down critical infrastructure;</p>
                <p style="margin-left:50px;">* distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that prevent legitimate users from accessing targeted computer networks or devices;</p>
                <p style="margin-left:50px;">* hacking and theft of critical data from institutions, governments and businesses;</p>
                <p style="margin-left:50px;">* spyware or cyber espionagethat results in the theft of information that compromises national security and stability;</p>
                <p style="margin-left:50px;">* ransomwarethat holds control systems or data hostage; and</p>
                <p style="margin-left:50px;">* propaganda or disinformation campaigns used to cause serious disruption or chaos.</p>
