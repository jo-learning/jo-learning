            <h1>Introduction to CyberSecurity</h1>
            <h2>What is Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>is the process of applying security measures to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.These  three  aspects,  confidentiality,  integrity,  and  availability, make your computer valuable to you. But viewed from another perspective, they are three possible ways to make it less  valuable, that is, to cause you harm. If someone steals your computer, scrambles data on your disk, or looks at your private data files, the value of your computer has been diminished or your computer use has been harmed. These characteristics are both basic security properties and the objects of security threats.

            <h3>Authentication</h3>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">* Authentication is the act of proving that asserted identity: that the person iswho she says she is.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">* Identificationis the act of asserting who a person is.</p>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">* Authentication is based on something you know, are, or have.</p>

            <h4>* Authentication Based on Phrases and Facts: Something You Know</h4>
            <p>Examples of authentication based on something you know are password, pin, patterns. Password protection seems to offer a relatively secure system for confirming identity-related information, but human practice sometimes degrades its quality.</p>
            <h4 style="margin-left: 50px;">Password Use</h4>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">The use of passwords is fairly straightforward, as you probably already know fromexperience. A user enters some piece of identification, such as a name or an assigned userID; this identification can be available to the public or can be easy to guess because it doesn’tprovide the real protection. The protection system then requests a password from theuser. If the password matches the one on file for the user, the user is authenticated andallowed access. If the password match fails, the system requests the password again, in casethe user mistyped.<br><br>
            Even though passwords are widely used, they suffer from some difficulties of use:<br><br>
            <b style="color: black;">Use. </b>Supplying a password for each access to an object can be inconvenientand time consuming.<br>
            <b style="color: black;">Disclosure. </b>If a user discloses a password to an unauthorized individual, theobject becomes immediately accessible. If the user then changes the password tore-protect the object, the user must inform any other legitimate users of the newpassword because their old password will fail.<br>
            <b style="color: black;">Revocation. </b>To revoke one user’s access right to an object, someone mustchange the password, thereby causing the same problems as disclosure.<br>
            <b style="color: black;">Loss. </b>Depending on how the passwords are implemented, it maybe impossibleto retrieve a lost or forgotten password. The operators or system administratorscan certainly intervene and provide a new password, but often they cannotdetermine what password a user had chosen previously. If the user loses (orforgets) the password, administrators must assign a new one.<br>
            <b style="color: red">Every password can be guessed; password strength is determined by howmany guesses are required.</b>
            </p>
            <h4 style="margin-left: 50px;">Password Use</h4>
            <b style="color: black; margin-left: 50px;">Dictionary Attacks</b>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">Several network sites post dictionaries of phrases, science fiction character names, places, mythological names, Chinese words, Yiddish words, and other specialized lists.These lists help site administrators identify users who have chosen weak passwords, but the same dictionaries can also be used by attackers of sites that do not have such attentive administrators.</p>

            <b style="color: black; margin-left: 50px;">Exhaustive Attack</b>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">In an exhaustive or brute force attack, the attacker tries all possible passwords, usually in some automated fashion. Of course, the number of possible passwords depends on the implementation of the particular computing system.<br><br>For example, if passwords are words consisting of the 26 characters A–Z and can be of any length from 1 to 8 characters, there are 261 passwords of 1 character, 262 passwords of 2 characters, and 268 passwords of 8 characters. Therefore, the system as a whole has 261 + 262 + ... + 268= 269–1 ̆5 * 1012 or five million million possible passwords.</p>

            <b style="color: black; margin-left: 50px;">Good Passwords</b>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">Chosen carefully, passwords can be strong authenticators. The term "password" impliesa single word, but you can actually use a nonexistent word or a phrase.So 2Brn2Bti? could be a password.</p>

            <h4>* Authentication Based on Biometrics: Something You Are</h4>
            <p>Biometricsare biological properties, based on some physical characteristic of the human body. The list of biometric authentication technologies is still growing. Now devices can recognize the following biometrics:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;"> * fingerprint<br>* hand geometry (shape and size of fingers)<br>* retina and iris (parts of the eye)<br>* voice<br>* handwriting, signature, hand motion<br>* typing characteristics<br>* blood vessels in the finger or hand<br>* face<br>* facial features, such as nose shape or eye spacing<br> </p>
            <p>Authentication with biometrics has advantages over passwords because a biometric cannot be lost, stolen, forgotten, or shared and is alwaysavailable, always at hand, so to speak. These characteristics are difficult, if not impossible, to forge.</p>

            <h4>* Authentication Based on Tokens: Something You Have</h4>
            <p>Something you have means that you have a physical object in your possession. One physical authenticator with which you are probably familiar is a key. When you put yourkey in your lock, the ridges in the key interact with pins in the lock to let the mechanismturn. In a sense the lock authenticates you for authorized entry because you possess an appropriate key. Of course, you can lose your key or duplicate it and give the duplicate to someone else, so the authentication is not perfect. But it is precise: Only your key works,and your key works only your lock.</p>
            <b style="color: black; margin-left: 50px;">Active and Passive Tokens</b>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">As the names imply, passive tokens do nothing, and active ones take some action. A photo or key is an example of a passive token in that the contents of the token never change.<br><br>An active token can have some variability or interaction with its surroundings. For example, some public transportation systems use cards with a magnetic strip. When youinsert the card into a reader, the machine reads the current balance, subtracts the price ofthe trip and rewrites a new balance for the next use. In this case, the token is just a repository to hold the current value. Another form of active token initiates a two-way communication with its reader, often by wireless or radio signaling. These tokens lead tothe next distinction among tokens, static and dynamic interaction.<br><br> Passive tokens do not change. Active tokens communicate with a sensor.</p>
            <h3>Access Control (Authorization)</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">In this section we discuss how to protect general objects, such as files, tables, access to hardware devices or network connections, and other resources. In general, wewant a flexible structure, so that certain users can use a resource in one way (for example, read-only), others in a different way (for example, allowing modification), and still others not a tall. We want techniques that are robust, easy to use, and efficient.<br><br>Access control: limiting who can access what in what ways.<br><br><b style="color: black;">Subjects.</b> are human users, often represented by surrogate programs running onbehalf of the users. <br> <b style="color: black;">Objects</b>are things on which an action can be performed: Files, tables,programs, memory objects, hardware devices, strings, data fields, network connections, and processors are examples of objects. So too are users, or rather programs or processes representing users, because the operating system (aprogram representing the system administrator) can act on a user, for example,allowing a user to execute a program, halting a user, or assigning privileges to auser.<br> <b style="color: black;">Access modes</b>are any controllable actions of subjects on objects, including, butnot limited to, read, write, modify, delete, execute, create, destroy, copy, export,import, and so forth.</p>
            <h3>nonrepudiation or accountability</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">the ability of a system to confirm that asender cannot convincingly deny having sent something.</p>
            <h3>Cryptography</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">Cryptography comes from Greek words Kryptos meaning hidden or secrete, Graphein meaning to write. Thus, cryptography is the art of secret writing for secure communication. For more information <a href="">Cryptography</a></p>
